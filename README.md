## Building

Building and starting the bot is all managed thru ./bin/appManager.sh. A listing of all available commands are below.

### AppManager CLI Usage 
```sh
./bin/appManager.sh [command] ["list of raspi IDs"] [remotePassword]
```

* [command] - required. See below for the full list of commands
* ["list of raspi IDs"] - (remote only) list of pis to be managed. Does lookup into iplist in global.sh
* [remotePassword] - (remote only) ssh password for the device(s)

| **stopRemoteVideo** | stop streaming cameras |
| **showKioskScreem** | launch chromium in kisok mode |


#### *Full Publish*
All publish commands remove and recreate the remote target directory on each publish to ensure a clean build.

| **publishSwim** | Pushes just the swim the package file to each device and unpacks it into the runtime folder |

#### *Partial Updates*
Update commands do not clean or remove any existing folders or code on the remote device.

| Command | Info | 
|---|---|
| **all** | Does a full package, publish and build to each device. Removes target install and build folders before publish and restarts the device once complete |
| **startRemote** | Stops and restarts target device. Cleans out temp files and swim db before start up. |
| **stopRemote** | Stops target device. |
| **updateRemote** | Pushes the full package file to each remote device, unpacks over the existing runtime, builds swim again and restarts the device |
| **quickRestart** | Stop and restart swim and web |

### Examples 

* Build, package, deploy the app to raspi3, 4, 5 , and 10 followed by restarting each device
```sh
./bin/appManager.sh all "3 10 4 5 6" MyPassWord
```

* Like the 'all' command but does not remove existing files or build node again. Faster then running all.
```sh
./bin/appManager.sh updateRemote "3 10 4 5 6" MyPassWord
```

* Stop and restart raspi3, 4, 5 , and 10
```sh
./bin/appManager.sh startRemote "3 10 4 5 6" MyPassWord
```
* Start up the full app locally
```sh
./bin/appManager.sh start
```

* Build the full app locally
```sh
./bin/appManager.sh build
```

* Build just the swim side of the app locally
```sh
./bin/appManager.sh buildSwim
```
