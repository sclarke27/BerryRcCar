## API & Documentation

### Receiver 

The `Receiver` class constructs objects that represent a single RC Receiver component.

```js
var receiver = new Receiver();

receiver.on("change", function() {
  console.log(this.x, this.y);
});
```

#### Options

| Property   | Type      | Value(s)/Description        | Default | Required |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------- |---------|----------|
| address    | number    | Address for I2C device \*   | `0x0A`  | no       |
| channels   | number    | Number of channels          | 6       | no       |
| channels   | array     | Array of channel names \*\* | \*\*    | no       |


```js
// Example of explicitly specified address
var receiver = new Receiver({
  address: 0x04
});
```

\* The I2C address defaults to `0x0A`, however digital pins 10 & 11 can be used to configure the address, according to the following table: 

| D11 | D12 | Address |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0x0A    |
| 0   | 1   | 0x0B    |
| 1   | 0   | 0x0C    |
| 1   | 1   | 0x0D    |


\*\* The built-in channel names are derived from the most commonly used names in the most common order: 

1. `throttle`
2. `aileron`
3. `elevator`
4. `rudder`
5. `gear`
6. `aux1`
7. `aux2`
8. `aux3`

When `channels: [...]` are specified, the length is used to set the channel count and the names provided are used to override the above listed names.


#### Properties

| Property | Type      | Value(s)/Description      |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 1-n      | number    | Each channel value is accessible via numeric channel property. These are NOT zero-indexed|


#### Iterable/Iterator Protocol

For code running in Node.js 4.2.x or newer, `Receiver` objects implement the [Iterable Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#iterable).

```js
var receiver = new Receiver();

// Create a zero-indexed array of receiver's current values:
var array = Array.from(receiver);
```

#### Events

- **change** Fired whenever any channel value changes.
- **change:[name]** Fired whenever the channel matching `[name]` changes.
  ```js
  receiver.on("change", function(change) {
    console.log("Channel(%d): %d", change.channel, change.value);
  });
  ```
  
  ```js
  receiver.on("change:throttle", function(change) {
    console.log("Throttle: %d", change.value);
  });
  ```

- **data** Fired as frequently as the hardware can be read.
